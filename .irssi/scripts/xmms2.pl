# XMMS/InfoPipe script for the Irssi client. You need a few things
# installed before this script will work...
#    1) Irssi,          http://irssi.org/
#    2) XMMS,           http://www.xmms.org/
#    3) InfoPipe,       http://www.beastwithin.org
#                       /users/wwwwolf/code/xmms/infopipe.html
#
# xmms2.pl is a version of xmms.pl slightly modified by Sir Robin,
# sir@robsku.cjb.net / http://robsku.cjb.net/
#
# The script now outputs by default to the active window, instead of
# status window. Also removed percentage meter as it didn't work. Only
# two lines were modified and the original lines still exist, just
# commented out.
#
# If you have trouble installing any of these, consult the READMEs that
# come with the software, thank you.
#
# Fixed a few vital things adviced by kodgehopper at netscape dot net.
# Very appreciated as I had no chance of testing a few of these things
# myself. I hope everything works as it should now.
